This is the personal vault of Ryosuke Kondo filled with both random and organized notes concerning my fourth year project `"Optimized Reasoning with Guarded Logic"`.

## About the Project

The aim of the project is to solve the "open world querying problem" in case of existential conjunctive queries together with a finite collection of Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (GTGDs) set as axioms.

The problem in the case of atomic queries has been solved by [`Rewriting the Infinite Chase`](https://krr-oxford.github.io/Guarded-saturation/files/p2537-benedikt-long.pdf) by means of rewriting the given set of GTGD rules to Datalog rules. This project tries to extend this result.

See [[Notations and Definitions]] for summary of concepts used in the above description.
