> This note builds on top of definitions in [[Chase-Like Trees and Saturated Chase-Like Trees]] and results in [[Preliminary Results on Saturated Chase-Like Trees]].

The aim of this note is to explain how the problem of deciding whether a query is witnessed inside a particular tentacle can be reduced to a query answering problem on a much smaller database.

## Tentacle Relevance Theorem

> **Definition**. Let $((\tau, \sigma))$ be a valid generative $\Sigma$-chase-path on a base instance $I$.

(TODO: build up to the tentacle relevance theorem)
