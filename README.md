# `"Optimized Reasoning with Guarded Logic"`

This is the personal vault of Ryosuke Kondo summarising random and organized notes concerning my fourth year research `"Optimized Reasoning with Guarded Logic"`.

## About the Project

The aim of the research is to solve the "open world querying problem" in case of existential conjunctive queries together with a finite collection of Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (GTGDs) set as axioms. The problem in the case of atomic (hence non-existential) queries has been solved (results are published on the paper [`Rewriting the Infinite Chase`](https://krr-oxford.github.io/Guarded-saturation/files/p2537-benedikt-long.pdf)), and our research tries to extend this result.

## Meta Information

Contents of this repository is mainly authored on Kondo's machine, git-managed and then synchronized to a [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kory33/obsidian-vault--private--yr-2022-2023-personal-research-notes).

TODO: setup a CI on GitHub that releases the page behind an authenticating proxy that allows just a few users (maybe just Kondo and professor Benedikt?) to access. I mean, why not? Should be fun to set that up.
