# `"Optimized Reasoning with Guarded Logic"`

This is the personal vault of Ryosuke Kondo filled with both random and organized notes concerning my fourth year research `"Optimized Reasoning with Guarded Logic"`.

## About the Project

The aim of the research is to solve the "open world querying problem" in case of existential conjunctive queries together with a finite collection of Guarded Tuple Generating Dependencies (GTGDs) set as axioms. The problem in the case of atomic (hence non-existential) queries has been solved (results are published on the paper [`Rewriting the Infinite Chase`](https://krr-oxford.github.io/Guarded-saturation/files/p2537-benedikt-long.pdf)), and our research tries to extend this result.

See [[Notations and Definitions]] for summary of concepts used in the above description.
